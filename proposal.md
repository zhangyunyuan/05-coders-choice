## Proposed Project

I'd like to build a appointment system for clinic. It's a console based system. Assume the clinic has several doctors. Patients shall be able to pick certain doctor, then choose a date and time period of that doctor to make appointment with him or her. If the date and time of that doctor are unavailable, the patient shall be able to be notified and restart.

## Outline Structure

The interface of the system would be command line based. A server to receive inputed information from the user. The server would handle the data retrieved from database and supervise them. Another supervisor would be used to supervise the appointment made successfully or not, ensure user would get second chance to restart the process.
